                    <p>In today’s dynamic business environment, companies irrespective of their size, face increased legal, compliance and regulatory challenges. Larger companies typically meet these challenges by employing an in-house general counsel – advocate (or group of advocates) employed full time – to provide legal support and guidance to the company. However, for many businesses, this may not be a viable option. The cost of hiring full-time, in-house advocates/ lawyers to provide advise regarding entity formations, transactions, corporate governance, employment matters, dispute avoidance and resolution, regulatory compliance checklists and other legal matters may simply be too high. At the same time, companies may also find that engaging a law firm on an hourly basis is not the best solution, as legal fees can escalate quickly.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Lex and Fin offers an alternative</h5>
                    <p>We provide outside general counsel services/in-house legal services in Pakistan on a fixed fee/ retainer basis.</p>

Lex and Fin’s incentive is to resolve the clients’ challenges quickly and accurately and not to create billable hours.</p>
                    <p>Since each business’ requirement is unique, our services are tailored to meet each client’s specific requirements and based on understanding the legal needs for smooth transactional and operational compliance, our specialized resources are assigned to provide dedicated services.</p>
